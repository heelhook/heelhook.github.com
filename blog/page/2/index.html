  <p>I recently wrote a post about my new media center, running off my laptop, well, while that setup was sweet and all, there was some sort of hole in it, that is, my laptop went belly up…</p>

<p>That was quite unfortunate, but it gave me the possibility to play with some new stuff, namely ITX setups.</p>

<p>I have finished yesterday building my ITX box, an Intel D510mo with an Atom D510 processor (dual with hyperthreading so 4 threads), 2 GB of RAM at 800 Mhz, WiFi PCI card on a Vitsuba Blackbox case, with a generic DVD-RW.</p>

<p>The setup is very sweet, I had lots of troubles building the system, at one point I thought my motherboard was faulty and I had to take it back to the store, but it seems the motherboard was ok, it was simply a matter of the mother producing a short while sitting in the case because of a mislocated screw in the case.</p>

<p>After the case was done I proceeded to install Ubuntu Karmic 9.10, to my surprise I had lots of troubles installing it, I had to perform the installation booting the netinstall through PXE (since I was out of CDs and all stores were closed). Once I was able to install Ubuntu I found that Ubuntu didn’t support the video card in the motherboard, and during the boot sequence the screen would go blank and there was pretty much nothing I could do about it.</p>

<p>Googling around I found other users with the same problem and determined to go with the same solution others had used… saying goodbye to Ubuntu and the beautiful Debian and APT world and totally selling out to the Fedora and Red Hat town (notice my strong bias :p).</p>

<p>I went through the horrible Fedora installation experience which is like getting hit on the ballsack while driving on a bike with no seat, configured GDM to autostart (which amazingly is not supported through gdm-config) and then I proceeded to build XBMC (since there is no XBMC build for non debian distributions (well done, and no, I’m not being ironic)).</p>

<p>It turns out building something like XBMC with support for many different codecs is not as straightforward as imaginable, who would have thought?! (now I am being ironic).</p>

<p>Here are some tips for others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add extra repositories (Fedora sucks)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Build XBMC</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>make -j 4
</span><span class='line'>make install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that the <code>make -j 4</code> command might succeed but not finish, I have found a few times that when using make in parallel even with multiple cores it will skip files, you want to use <code>make -j 4</code> a few times to accelerate the process but do make sure its actually finished running make.</p>

  <p>I have recently come across this eye opening post. I mean, it probably was eye opening back when it was written in 1995, heck, I bet most Newsweek readers back then yelled something like “I knew it, that Internet thing is bullcrap!”.</p>

<p>This article, astonishingly titled <a href="http://threewordchant.com/2010/02/24/why-the-internet-will-fail-from-1995/">Why the internet will fail</a>, runs down through the many reasons why Internet would be something we would all get over soon really quickly, like we did with Tamagotchis (thankfully).</p>

<p>Now, this is not your run of the mill ignorant news reporter who talks about things s/he doesn’t understand, this was written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Stoll">Clifford Stoll</a>, an astronomer and technology writer, working out of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Yet, he can be quoted saying</p>

<blockquote><p>Yet Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we’ll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Intenet. Uh, sure.</p></blockquote>

<p>This author was an authority, someone that we could think that knows much more than we do, so if we disagree with his view we might want to review our opinion.</p>

<p>And this is something that I have seen over and over again, the number of specialists, analysts, etcists, that express an opinion on their field and its completely wrong, completely off base. Of course, we are all humans, we tend to make mistakes, so don’t take this as being judgmental, I’m just saying, we should listen, but we should selectively listen and always make up our own mind and not act on other’s opinions but our own.</p>

  <p>I have recently read a quote attributed to Einstein, it reads something along the lines of “the best ideas I have I have them while I shave”. This got me thinking, how much idle time do I have on any given month?</p>

<p>I am an Internet junky, and completely obsessed with efficiency, so I may not be a good statistical sample, but bear with me on this one.</p>

<p>Aftter considering the different idle times we get throughout our daily lives, commuting, personal care time, all meals, I have realized that most of those times I have occupied them (except commute since I work out of my home office) with some supposedly time saving activity, whether it is checking my email, browsing, reading blogs, even when I shower I have managed to be able to do “something”, even if it is just listening to music (come to think about it maybe I could tune some podcasts).</p>

<p>It feels like I’m constantly multitasking, maybe this is a good thing, or maybe not. Even now, I am on my way to a medical check up writing this post on my iPhone.</p>

<p>This forces me to ask myself “What’s the value of idle time?”. For some reason it feels like my ideas begin to flow so much better when I’m not doing something else, when I’m only commuting. It would seem like our information overload and constantly-online capabilities on our smartphones, our inclination to be constatly productive has actually defeated it’s own purpose messing with our creativity.</p>

<p>Listening to other people’s ideas requires not listening to ours, at least for a brief moment. You can use others’ ideas as a trigger for inspiration but at one point the marginal value of listening becomes detrimental to our own creativity and innovation. In the very same way that this happens with consumers indifference curves this can’t be quantifies nor generalized as more people require more listening and some people require less listening.</p>

<p>Ok enough about this, I’m going to continue reading on my kindle now.</p>

  <p>I have recently had the opportunity to help out a friend who is launching her own company. This is the first time I have informally gave advice to a fellow entrepreneur and I have found it to be a very rich experience, where a lot of value is easily created, strengthening the “core friendship” in the process.</p>

<p>From a purely selfish point of view I have been enjoying myself, opening up to a new industry I haven’t gave too much thought ever before, and sharing ideas on the go. I have seen this before, but being the reminded of the richness of bouncing ideas off someones head and seeing what comes back at you is always a good and enjoyable thing.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I wish her the best of lucks in her new endeavor! Best of lucks, Lucila!</p>
